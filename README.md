&emsp; I am current Student at Saint Leo University working to complete my Bachelors in Cybersecurity. Then once completed I will most likely return to Wilmington University to finish off my Bachelors in Computer Science. I am a veteran and not currently working in the field. As I near the end of my professional schooling. I have been in the process of applying for different interships and job opportunities.

&emsp; At Home I maintain my home network which consists of 1) pfSense security device, 1) NGINX reverse proxy VM to create a secure home lan with certificates. 1) 3 node proxmox cluster Bulit on three 6th gen intel computers that has high avalibility set up, 1) Home bulit Nas on a 13th gen intel, 6) personal computers two home built, and a Minecraft Server I host for my daughter and her friends. My home Hardware does include unifi switches and a unifi WAP which allows me to learn the unifi ecosystem. Some off the popular software I use is home assistiant, zabbix, wazuh, nextcloud, piehole, and many others.



&emsp; Recently, I completed the Google Ai Essentials and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Google Ai and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst or forensic investigator. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, communication skills to address problems and emerging threats, and previous law enforcement type background and studies.

  > In 2025, I am preparing to take the Linux Foundation Certified Associate (LFCA), CompTIA A+, CompTIA Network+ and CompTIA Security+
