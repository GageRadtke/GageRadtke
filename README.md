I am Gage Radtke. I am current Student at Saint Leo University working to complete my Bachelors in Cybersecurity. Then most likely finish off my Bachelors in Computer Science. I am a veteran using educational benifiets at the moment and not currently working in the field. As I near the end of my professional schooling. I have been in the process of applying for different interships and job opportunities. 

Recently, I completed the Google Ai Essentials and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate to pursue my passion for technology and Cybersecurity. The Google Ai and Cybersecurity Professional Certificate have prepared me for industry-ready jobs. My ultimate goal is to become a Security Analyst or forensic investigator. This role suits me because I have strong analytical abilities, persistence, eagerness to learn, a can-do attitude, problem-solving skills, communication skills to address problems and emerging threats, and previous law enforcement type background and studies. 

As of 2025, I am preparing to take the `Linux Foundation Certified Associate (LFCA)`, `CompTIA A+`, `CompTIA Network+` and `CompTIA Security+` certifications.
